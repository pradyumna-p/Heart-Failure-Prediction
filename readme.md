# Heart Failure Prediction Project

1. Overview:
This project focuses on predicting heart failure using machine learning models. The dataset includes various health-related features, and different classifiers are employed to predict the likelihood of a heart failure event.

2. Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- Age
- Creatinine Phosphokinase
- Ejection Fraction
- Serum Creatinine
- Serum Sodium
- Time
The target variable is the presence or absence of a "DEATH_EVENT."

3. Project Structure:
- heart_failure_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project

4. Models Used:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Support Vector Machine (SVC)
    3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    4. Random Forest Classifier

5. Evaluation:
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and the results are visualized using a bar chart for easy comparison.

6. Future Improvements:
- Consider fine-tuning hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Explore additional classifiers or advanced machine learning techniques.
- Incorporate feature engineering for potentially enhanced predictions.
